#CCRS - Citizen Complaint Redressal System

The basic idea behind our idea is to increase transparency between government and citizens.

If some citizen has complaint regarding the damaged road, where would he go? 
The first idea would be to go the Nagarpalika. Let us assume that the citizen went to nagarpalika.

He then complained about the damaged road in his area to the nagarpalika officer. The officer assured him that the road will be repaired. 15 days passed but the road was not repaired. He went to the nagarpalika again and complained for the same. The nagarpalika officer told that he never came previously to complaint. These scenarios are very often… We see and hear them in regular days.

If we try to complaint about something, the complaints are usually suppressed by the powerful ones. The citizens don’t have any medium to complaint about small things like roads, education, improper supply of water, lack of facilities in hospitals, etc. Even if they complaint somewhere, the track of the application they submitted is not present. They can’t know where their application has reached. It always gets lost from one table to another table in offices.

So, CCRS is a medium where citizens can raise their voices and file up the complaints. Citizens will have to register themselves with the app. Once registered, they need to login. During the time of login, an otp will be sent to their registered mobile number. After logging into the app, they can send a complaint. They need to specify the complete details of their complaint. They can also submit a supportive image to enhance the impact of the complaint. The user can track their complaints also. Once the complaint is filed, the admin and the citizen will be notified.

The admin would be the highest authority of the city. The admin will be able to view the complaints and change the status of the complaints accordingly. Once the complaint has been solved, respective citizen will get notified.

The basic and prime advantage of CCRS is that, now no citizen’s voice will be suppressed and all the complaints will reach to the proper authority.
